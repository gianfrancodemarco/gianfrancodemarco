<h1> Hello there! </h1>

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Gianfranco Demarco, a 23-year-old Software Engineer deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence.

ðŸ“˜ Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence while working a full-time role as a Software Engineer.

ðŸ’¼ I come with a comprehensive background in both frontend and backend development, coupled with proficiency in database management. 

ðŸ§  However, lately I'm dedicated *head and fingers* to the world of Machine Learning, experimenting with every aspect of the field.  
This includes building models with renowned libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch and HuggingFace, as well as effectively managing the software and experiments lifecycle using tools such as MLFlow, DVC and Dagshub.  

ðŸ”„ I'm also actively engaged in practicing CI/CD, as well as deploying and monitoring models and applications.

<br>

ðŸ“Š Feel free to explore my GitHub portfolio, where you'll find a lot of unfinished efforts ðŸ˜¬ and some end to end projects.  
You may even find *The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything* hidden somewhere. ðŸ¥·
